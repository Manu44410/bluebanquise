## Community

![BlueBanquise Community](resources/pictures/BlueBanquise_Community_logo_large.png)

This repository hosts all community driven roles or tools around [**BlueBanquise**](https://github.com/bluebanquise/bluebanquise). These addition roles/tools can be new, or simply forks from the [core stack](https://github.com/bluebanquise/bluebanquise/tree/master/roles).

Each role/tool is owned by a developer, in charge of it.

Each owner can ask a new release of the repository, as this repository was made to provide fast releases cycle to core external roles/tools.

While the core stack aims to be multiple Linux distributions ready, each Community role owner is in charge of providing compatibility with Linux distributions (or not) for the additional role.
